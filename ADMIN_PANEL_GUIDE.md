2. **Featured Projects**: Only select your best 3 projects to feature on the homepage
3. **Blog Posts**: Use the scheduling feature to plan your content calendar
4. **Resources**: Organize resources into logical categories for better user experience
5. **Activity Logs**: Regularly review activity logs to monitor changes and ensure security

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Login Problems**: Make sure you're using the authorized email address
2. **Image Upload Failures**: Check that your image file size is reasonable (under 5MB)
3. **Content Not Updating**: Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache
4. **Error Messages**: Note any error messages and contact the developer if needed
