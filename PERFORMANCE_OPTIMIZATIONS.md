# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve loading speed and overall performance of the portfolio website.

## Image Optimizations

1. **Image Format Optimization**
   - Added support for modern image formats (AVIF, WebP)
   - Set proper image quality and sizes

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Implemented proper lazy loading for images below the fold
   - Added blur placeholders for better user experience during loading

3. **Image Component Optimization**
   - Enhanced `AnimatedImage` and `ProjectImage` components with:
     - Optimized animation durations (reduced from 1s to 0.5s)
     - Proper image sizing based on viewport
     - Memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
     - Blur placeholders during loading

4. **Image URL Optimization**
   - Created utility functions to optimize image URLs
   - Added width and quality parameters to Firebase Storage URLs

## Data Fetching Optimizations

1. **Client-side Caching**
   - Implemented a data caching utility to reduce redundant API calls
   - Set appropriate cache durations for different types of content:
     - Long-lived content (1 hour): Hero, About sections
     - Medium-lived content (15 minutes): Projects, Resources
     - Short-lived content (5 minutes): Blog posts, Footer

2. **Optimized Firebase Queries**
   - Reduced unnecessary console logging
   - Implemented proper error handling with fallbacks to cached data

3. **Component Memoization**
   - Added memoization to frequently used components
   - Used React's `useCallback` for event handlers and functions

## Build and Runtime Optimizations

1. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Enabled SWC minification for faster builds
   - Disabled source maps in production
   - Implemented HTTP caching headers for static assets
   - Added DNS prefetching

2. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Added bundle analyzer for monitoring bundle size
   - Set up console removal in production builds
   - Implemented proper code splitting

3. **React Optimizations**
   - Enabled React strict mode for better performance
   - Implemented proper component structure to minimize re-renders

## Deployment Optimizations

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Set up long-term caching for static assets (1 year for images)
   - Implemented proper cache invalidation strategy

2. **Build Process**
   - Added clean build script to ensure fresh builds
   - Optimized production build process

## Additional Optimizations

1. **Typography Plugin Configuration**
   - Properly configured Tailwind Typography plugin for blog content
   - Optimized styling for better readability and performance

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Reduced animation complexity and duration
   - Used hardware-accelerated properties for animations

These optimizations collectively improve the website's loading speed, reduce unnecessary network requests, and enhance the overall user experience.
